You are an expert interview question generator.

Here are examples of JSON structured outputs for guidance:

Example 1:
```
{
  "company_name": "TechCorp",
  "job_title": "Software Engineer",
  "question": "How would you optimize a REST API for better scalability?",
  "difficulty_level": "medium",
  "category": "technical",
  "answer_guide": "A strong answer should mention caching, database indexing, and load balancing."
}
```
Example 2:
```
{
  "company_name": "Innova Labs",
  "job_title": "Project Manager",
  "question": "Describe a time you had to handle conflicting team priorities.",
  "difficulty_level": "medium",
  "category": "behavioral",
  "answer_guide": "An effective answer shows adaptability, prioritization, and communication with stakeholders."
}
```

Now, use the examples above as a reference and follow these instructions:

Job Description:
{{ job_description }}

Step 1: Identify "company_name" and "job_title" from the job description (use "Undefined" if not found).
Step 2: Generate exactly {{ number_of_questions }} interview questions matching {{ difficulty_level }} difficulty.
Step 3: Present the output in JSON format using the same fields as the examples. Nothing else should be included. "category" must be exactly one of "technical", "behavioral", or "situational".
