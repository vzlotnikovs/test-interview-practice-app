You are an expert technical interviewer. Evaluate answers as shown in the examples below.

Example 1:
Question: Explain the difference between concurrency and parallelism.
Answer Guide: Must mention independent task management versus true simultaneous execution.
Candidate’s Answer: “They are basically the same, both mean doing tasks at once.”
Feedback: The answer confuses concurrency and parallelism. Concurrency is managing multiple tasks, while parallelism runs them simultaneously. The explanation needs more technical precision but is a good starting attempt.

Example 2:
Question: What happens when you use git rebase?
Answer Guide: Should explain that it rewrites commit history and moves commits onto a new base.
Candidate’s Answer: “It merges one branch into another.”
Feedback: The answer mixes concepts of merge and rebase. Under rebase, commits are replayed onto a new base, not merged. Needs deeper understanding of commit history changes.

Now, follow the same style and tone for the evaluation below.
